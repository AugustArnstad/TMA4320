Introduction to Scientific Computation
The course consists of two equal parts: theoretical and practical/computational. 
The theoretical part of the course introduces the participants to numerical mathematics and prepares them for the scientific computing part. 
The latter consists of three compulsory projects originating from physics, biophysics and mathematics. 
Potential topics covered by the course are methods for evaluating integrals, solving systems of differential equations, linear and non-linear equations, and interpolation.
